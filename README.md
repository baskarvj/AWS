## What is cloud computing ?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Types of cloud computing ?

  Three types of cloud computing are :
  
•	public cloud  cloud 
•	private cloud  on-premises

## Difference between an AWS Region and Availability Zone:

1. AWS Regions are large and widely dispersed into separate geographic locations. Availability Zones are distinct locations within an AWS Region.
2. A region can have multiple Availability Zones, but an Availability Zone cannot belong to more than one Region.
3. Configuring an application to run on different Availability Zones within a region is easier than configuring the application on different regions.

 

Here are some of the AWS regions and the corresponding availability zones:

US East (N. Virginia)
us-east-1a
us-east-1b
us-east-1c
us-east-1d
us-east-1e

US West (Oregon)
us-west-2a
us-west-2b
us-west-2c

EU (Ireland)
eu-west-1a
eu-west-1b
eu-west-1c

Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
ap-south-1a
ap-south-1b

South America (Sao Paulo)
sa-east-1a
sa-east-1b



## EC2 (Elastic compute cloud)  Creation

By default, AWS has a limit of 20 instances per region. This includes all instances set up on your AWS account. To increase EC2 limits, request a higher limit by providing information about the new limit and regions where it should be applied.
